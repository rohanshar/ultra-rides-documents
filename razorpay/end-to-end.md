### Data Storage and Interaction with Razorpay

During the club organizer onboarding process, you will need to save the collected information in your database (DB) and interact with Razorpay APIs to create linked accounts and configure product settings. Here's how you can manage both aspects:

#### 1. **Data Storage in Your Database**
Store the following information in your database to maintain a record of club organizers and their details:

- **Account Creation**:
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Password (hashed for security)
  - Legal Business Name
  - Business Type

- **Business Details**:
  - Contact Name
  - Business Address:
    - Street Address
    - City
    - State
    - Postal Code
    - Country
  - Legal Information:
    - PAN Number
    - GST Number

- **Stakeholder Information**:
  - Stakeholder Name
  - Residential Address:
    - Street Address
    - City
    - State
    - Postal Code
    - Country
  - KYC Information:
    - PAN Number

- **Bank Details**:
  - Bank Account Number
  - IFSC Code
  - Beneficiary Name

- **Miscellaneous**:
  - Terms and Conditions Acceptance (boolean)

#### 2. **Interaction with Razorpay APIs**
At different stages of the onboarding process, you will interact with Razorpay APIs to create linked accounts, add stakeholders, and configure product settings.

##### Steps to Interact with Razorpay

1. **Creating a Linked Account**:
   - After collecting basic account creation details, use the Razorpay API to create a linked account.
   - Save the returned `account_id` in your database.

   ```bash
   curl --location 'https://api.razorpay.com/v2/accounts' \
   --header 'Content-type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '{
      "email":"{email}",
      "phone":"{phone}",
      "type":"route",
      "reference_id":"{reference_id}",
      "legal_business_name":"{legal_business_name}",
      "business_type":"{business_type}",
      "contact_name":"{contact_name}",
      "profile":{
         "category":"healthcare",
         "subcategory":"clinic",
         "addresses":{
            "registered":{
               "street1":"{street1}",
               "street2":"{street2}",
               "city":"{city}",
               "state":"{state}",
               "postal_code":"{postal_code}",
               "country":"{country}"
            }
         }
      },
      "legal_info":{
         "pan":"{pan}",
         "gst":"{gst}"
      }
   }'
   ```

2. **Creating Stakeholders**:
   - After creating the linked account, create stakeholders using the `account_id` from the previous step.
   - Save the returned `stakeholder_id` in your database.

   ```bash
   curl --location 'https://api.razorpay.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/stakeholders' \
   --header 'Content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{
      "name":"{stakeholder_name}",
      "addresses":{
         "residential":{
            "street":"{residential_street}",
            "city":"{residential_city}",
            "state":"{residential_state}",
            "postal_code":"{residential_postal_code}",
            "country":"{residential_country}"
         }
      },
      "kyc":{
         "pan":"{stakeholder_pan}"
      },
      "notes":{
         "random_key_by_partner":"random_value"
      }
   }'
   ```

3. **Requesting Product Configuration**:
   - Request a product configuration for the linked account to set up the financial product or service.

   ```bash
   curl --location 'https://api.razorpay.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/products' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{
      "product_name":"route",
      "tnc_accepted":true
   }'
   ```

4. **Updating Product Configuration**:
   - Update the product configuration to include bank details for settlements.

   ```bash
   curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.razorpay.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/products/{product_id}/' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data '{
      "settlements":{
         "account_number":"{bank_account_number}",
         "ifsc_code":"{ifsc_code}",
         "beneficiary_name":"{beneficiary_name}"
      },
      "tnc_accepted":true
   }'
   ```

### Workflow Summary

1. **User Interface (UI) Interactions**:
   - Collect the necessary information through a series of forms in the UI.
   - Store the collected information in your database for record-keeping and future reference.

2. **Backend Interactions**:
   - Use the stored information to interact with Razorpay APIs to create linked accounts, stakeholders, and configure product settings.
   - Save the responses from Razorpay (like `account_id` and `stakeholder_id`) back into your database.

3. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Implement error handling to manage any issues that arise during the API interactions (e.g., invalid data, API errors).
   - Validate the input data to ensure it meets Razorpay's requirements before making API calls.

By following this approach, you can ensure a seamless onboarding experience for club organizers and integrate Razorpay effectively into your workflow.
